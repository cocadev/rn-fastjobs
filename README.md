## :dizzy: **Roadmap**

-   [x] Make it work on IOS
-   [x] Make it work on Android
-   [x] Make it work on Expo
-   [x] Transform into responsive
-   [x] Update to latest React Native version

## :wrench: **Install instructions**

### Getting Started

#### 1) Clone & Install Dependencies

- 1.1) `git clone https://github.com/kingofdevs/rn-fastjobs.git`
- 1.2) `cd rn-fastjobs` - cd into your newly created project directory.
- 1.3) Install NPM packages with `yarn install`
        **Note:** NPM has issues with React Native so `yarn` is recommended over `npm`.
#### 2) Start your app

- 2.1) **[EXPO]** Build and run the iOS app, run `expo run-ios` (to run on simulator) or `expo --device` (to run on real device) from the root of your project. The first build will take some time.
